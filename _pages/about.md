# About Me

I am an CSE PhD sudent in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk) HKUST, supervised by Professor [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/). Out of Distribution  (OOD) Generalization , Robustess of Deep Learning and Learning theory are my research interests. If you are interested in discussing / cooperating with me on OOD, you can contact me by Email. 

# News
* 2022.10, I lunched a blog on Invariant Risk Minimization [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/567666715) (in Chinese).
* 2022.09, one paper was accepted by NeurIPS 2022 as **SPOTLIGHT** presentation
* 2022.05, three papers were accepted by ICML 2022
* 2022.03, one paper was accepted by CVPR 2022 as **ORAL** presentation
